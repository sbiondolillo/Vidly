# Vidly
ASP.NET Web Application for a video rental service

## Synopsis

A simple MVC5 app for a hypothetical video rental store. Uses both vanilla MVC5 to render markup and WebAPI to serve up data in conjunction with Entity Framework 6 for O/RM.

## Motivation

This project was built to familiarize myself with the .NET MVC5 Framework. I use this project to test out new libraries , tools, and designs. Things like toastr, typeahead, or automapper are tested here first before being brought into my production apps.
